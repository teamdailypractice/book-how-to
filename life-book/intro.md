# Life - How to Live Today?

* What is my plan for today?
  * Did I write it down in a notebook/calendar/tasks?
  * 3 to 5 items - prioritize - write it in a line or two
* Why having a plan for today is important?
  * Today is the foundation of tomorrow
  * When tomorrow comes, it comes as today then today would become yesterday
  * Today would become Past; Today would become Future
  * Focus on Today
* Review at the end of the Day
  * What did I learn today?
  * What are the good things today?
  * What mistakes I made today?
    * Why?
    * How could I change my behaviour?
